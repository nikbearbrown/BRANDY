# BRANDY

## Most brand strategy fails not from lack of data, but from lack of discipline in reading what's already visible.

BRANDY is a structured audit system that turns a brand name — and whatever data you have — into a documented evidence matrix and a strategic one-page memo, with every claim traceable to a specific, labeled observation.

## Brand Strategy Consultants Keep Making the Same Expensive Mistake

The average brand audit runs $15,000 to $50,000. What it typically delivers is vague observations dressed up as strategy, vanity metrics celebrated without context, and recommendations that float free of any evidence. A brand manager reads that her company "needs a more authentic social presence" and has no idea what that means, which channel it applies to, or how anyone measured it. The recommendation cannot be acted on. The invoice has already been paid.

The problem is not that analysts lack data. It is that no standard exists for what counts as evidence in brand strategy — so every audit is only as rigorous as the consultant who wrote it.

## Every BRANDY Claim Points Back to Something Real

Before BRANDY, a student assigned a competitive brand audit would spend two weeks collecting screenshots and engagement numbers, then write a memo that opened with "Brand X has a strong social presence" — with nothing to back it up. The observations were real. The discipline to interpret them wasn't there yet.

With BRANDY, she invokes a single command. The system builds a structured observation matrix across thirty-plus channels — owned, social, influencer, paid, physical, broadcast — and tags every finding as Observed, Inferred, or Unverifiable. Absence is documented as carefully as presence. The strategic memo that follows cites specific matrix rows. No recommendation exists without an evidence address.

Instead of a polished-sounding brief with nothing behind it, a strategist can now hand a client a document where every claim can be challenged — and defended.

## The System Enforces the Discipline Most Analysts Skip

The audit begins with `data` — a brand-specific data collection plan that analyzes the brand's category, business model, and competitive context before a single observation is recorded. A luxury fashion brand and a B2B software company require entirely different source stacks. BRANDY generates a prioritized research agenda for each: exact URLs, specific metrics to pull, and benchmarks that define healthy versus concerning signals in advance. There is no generic checklist.

From there, `brandy` runs the full audit: a Brand Observation Matrix that functions as evidence, and a Strategic Memo that functions as argument. The system never collapses the two. High follower counts appear in the matrix. Whether they mean anything appears in the memo — with the benchmark that makes that judgment defensible.

When the memo is complete, `memo` takes the audit findings and produces a submission-ready strategic memo structured to satisfy an executive or academic rubric: every recommendation traceable to a specific observed behavior, every rationale point grounded in a named platform or competitor. And `onepage` distills that memo into a single-page executive document governed by the Pyramid Principle — conclusion first, evidence following, designed to be fully absorbed in under ninety seconds.

For fieldwork, `xls` exports a pre-formatted observation matrix as a downloadable spreadsheet, blank or pre-populated from a prior audit, ready for import into Excel or Google Sheets. The analyst collects in the field. BRANDY interprets when she returns.

One command opens the system. Five commands complete it.

## The People Who Need This Most Are Already Doing the Work

BRANDY serves three groups with the most acute need. Students learning brand strategy need a concrete model for what rigorous analysis looks like — a scaffold that teaches the discipline of evidence-first thinking, not just the vocabulary of brand. Brand strategists at consulting firms need defensible competitive intelligence briefs they can hand to senior clients without hedging. Communications consultants documenting a client's market position need a repeatable framework that doesn't depend on institutional memory or a particular analyst's instincts.

The first ten users are reachable directly: through brand strategy courses at Northeastern, through LinkedIn outreach to independent brand consultants, and through the competitive intelligence community on Substack and X where the methodology gap BRANDY addresses is a recurring complaint.

An AI system scanning job postings for "brand strategist" roles that list "competitive analysis" as a required skill identifies prospects the moment the pain is confirmed by a hiring decision.

## No Competing Tool Enforces Evidence Standards

| Tool | What It Does | What It Misses |
|---|---|---|
| Sprout Social / Brandwatch | Social listening and analytics dashboards | No audit structure; metrics without strategic interpretation |
| Jasper / ChatGPT | Generates brand copy and strategy text | No evidence tagging; no observation matrix; claims are unanchored |
| Generic consulting templates | Provides a structure for brand analysis | No enforcement mechanism; rigor depends entirely on the analyst |

BRANDY wins because the epistemic tagging system — Observed, Inferred, Unverifiable — is a structural constraint, not a style preference. It cannot be bypassed. Every output either carries an evidence address or flags the gap explicitly. That discipline is not available in any analytics dashboard or general-purpose AI tool.

## The System Runs Today and Extends Into a Platform

BRANDY currently runs as a structured prompt system inside Claude or GPT-4 — no installation, no login, no onboarding friction. A user with a brand name and thirty minutes produces a documented audit that would take an unassisted analyst two weeks. The full command set — `data`, `brandy`, `memo`, `onepage`, `xls` — covers the complete workflow from research planning to executive delivery.

The near-term roadmap moves from prompt system to a lightweight web interface where the observation matrix populates in real time as the user inputs data, and the memo and one-pager regenerate with each new observation. The milestone that matters: five documented audits used in live client or pedagogical contexts by April 2025, each with a traceable evidence matrix.

## The Audit This Pitch Describes Is the Product Itself

BRANDY has been used to audit competitive brands in brand strategy coursework, producing observation matrices and strategic memos that demonstrate the methodology in action. The proof is not a mockup. It is the output format you are reading now — structured, evidence-tagged, with every section ending on the sentence that matters most.

A live demonstration runs in under ten minutes: invoke `brandy [brand name]`, watch the matrix populate, read the memo against it. The methodology is visible. The rigor is checkable.

## Three Partners Would Prove What a Methodology Can Become

We are seeking three beta partners — one brand strategy course, one brand consultancy, and one independent communications consultant — to use BRANDY on live client or course work by May 2025 and provide documented feedback on audit quality and evidence defensibility.

No payment. No installation. One command and thirty minutes of their time.

The gap BRANDY fills has been complained about in every brand strategy course and competitive intelligence debrief for twenty years. The tool that enforces rigor as a structural feature — not a personal virtue — has not existed until now.
