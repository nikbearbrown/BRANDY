# BRANDY
### Brand Communications Audit System

**Most brand strategy fails not from lack of data, but from lack of discipline in reading what's already visible.**

BRANDY is a structured audit system that turns a brand name — and whatever data you have — into a documented evidence matrix and a strategic one-page memo, with every claim traceable to a specific, labeled observation.

---

## Brand Strategy Consultants Keep Making the Same Expensive Mistake

The average brand audit runs $15,000 to $50,000. What it typically delivers is vague observations dressed up as strategy, vanity metrics celebrated without context, and recommendations that float free of any evidence. A brand manager reads that her company "needs a more authentic social presence" and has no idea what that means, which channel it applies to, or how anyone measured it. The recommendation cannot be acted on. The invoice has already been paid.

The problem is not that analysts lack data. It is that no standard exists for what counts as evidence in brand strategy — so every audit is only as rigorous as the consultant who wrote it.

---

## Every BRANDY Claim Points Back to Something Real

Before BRANDY, a student assigned a competitive brand audit would spend two weeks collecting screenshots and engagement numbers, then write a memo that opened with "Brand X has a strong social presence" — with nothing to back it up. The observations were real. The discipline to interpret them wasn't there yet.

With BRANDY, she invokes a single command. The system builds a structured observation matrix across thirty-plus channels — owned, social, influencer, paid, physical, broadcast — and tags every finding as Observed, Inferred, or Unverifiable. Absence is documented as carefully as presence. The strategic memo that follows cites specific matrix rows. No recommendation exists without an evidence address.

Instead of a polished-sounding brief with nothing behind it, a strategist can now hand a client a document where every claim can be challenged — and defended.

---

## The System Enforces the Discipline Most Analysts Skip

The audit begins with a data collection plan specific to the brand's category and competitive context. A luxury fashion brand and a B2B SaaS company require entirely different source stacks; BRANDY generates a prioritized research agenda for each, with exact URLs, specific metrics to pull, and benchmarks that define healthy versus concerning signals before a single observation is recorded.

The full audit then runs across two outputs: a Brand Observation Matrix that functions as evidence, and a Strategic One-Page Memo that functions as argument. The system never collapses the two. High follower counts appear in the matrix. Whether they mean anything appears in the memo — with the benchmark that makes that judgment defensible.

---

## The People Who Need This Most Are Already Doing the Work

BRANDY serves three groups with the most acute need. Students learning brand strategy need a concrete model for what rigorous analysis looks like — a scaffold that teaches the discipline of evidence-first thinking, not just the vocabulary of brand. Brand strategists at consulting firms need defensible competitive intelligence briefs they can hand to senior clients without hedging. Communications consultants documenting a client's market position need a repeatable framework that doesn't depend on institutional memory or a particular analyst's instincts.

The first ten users are reachable directly: through MBA brand strategy course rosters at Northeastern, through LinkedIn outreach to independent brand consultants, and through the competitive intelligence community on Substack and Twitter where the methodology gap BRANDY addresses is a recurring complaint.

An AI system scanning job postings for "brand strategist" roles that list "competitive analysis" as a required skill identifies prospects the moment the pain is confirmed by a hiring decision.

## No Competing Tool Enforces Evidence Standards

| Tool | What It Does | What It Misses |
|---|---|---|
| Sprout Social / Brandwatch | Social listening and analytics dashboards | No audit structure; metrics without strategic interpretation |
| Jasper / ChatGPT | Generates brand copy and strategy text | No evidence tagging; no observation matrix; claims are unanchored |
| Generic consulting templates | Provides a structure for brand analysis | No enforcement mechanism; rigor depends entirely on the analyst |

BRANDY wins because the epistemic tagging system — Observed, Inferred, Unverifiable — is a structural constraint, not a style preference. It cannot be bypassed. Every output either has an evidence address or it flags the gap explicitly. That discipline is not available in any analytics dashboard or general-purpose AI tool.

---

## The System Runs Today and Extends Into a Platform

BRANDY currently runs as a structured prompt system inside Claude or GPT-4 — no installation, no login, no onboarding friction. A user with a brand name and thirty minutes produces a documented audit that would take an unassisted analyst two weeks.

The near-term roadmap moves from prompt system to a lightweight web interface where the observation matrix populates in real time as the user inputs data, and the memo regenerates with each new observation. The milestone that matters: five documented audits used in live client or academic contexts by April 2025, each with a traceable evidence matrix.

---

## The Audit This Pitch Describes Is the Product Itself

BRANDY has been used to audit competitive brands in MBA brand strategy coursework, producing observation matrices and strategic memos that demonstrate the methodology in action. The proof is not a mockup. It is the output format you are reading now — structured, evidence-tagged, with every section ending on the sentence that matters most.

A live demonstration runs in under ten minutes: invoke `brandy [brand name]`, watch the matrix populate, read the memo against it. The methodology is visible. The rigor is checkable.

---

## Three Partners Would Prove What a Methodology Can Become

We are seeking three beta partners — one MBA program, one brand consultancy, and one independent communications consultant — to use BRANDY on live client or course work by May 2025 and provide documented feedback on audit quality and evidence defensibility.

No payment. No installation. One command and thirty minutes of their time.

The gap BRANDY fills has been complained about in every brand strategy course and competitive intelligence debrief for twenty years. The tool that enforces rigor as a structural feature — not a personal virtue — has not existed until now.

# BRANDY — Brand Communications Audit Command Map

BRANDY is a systematic brand communications auditing tool. It transforms raw observations across every touchpoint into a structured diagnostic and a strategic one-page memo. It operates without fuzzy thinking, vanity metrics, or rhetorical padding. Every recommendation traces to a specific observation.

---

## BRANDY has three commands:

**`brandy [brand name]`** — Full Brand Communications Audit
Audits a brand across all owned, paid, earned, and shared touchpoints. Produces a completed observation matrix and a one-page strategic memo with recommendations. Accepts a brand name alone, partial data, or a full data dump.

**`data [brand name]`** — Brand Data Source Intelligence Brief
Analyzes the brand's category, business model, and competitive context, then generates a prioritized, brand-specific data collection plan. Tells you *which specific sources matter most for this brand* and *what analysis to run on what you collect.*

**`help`** — This guide.

---

## How to invoke `brandy`:

```
brandy Nike
brandy Peloton — here's what I found so far: [paste notes]
brandy [brand name] — competitor to [group project brand]
brandy [brand name] — focus memo on outmaneuvering [rival brand]
```

## How to invoke `data`:

```
data Spotify
data Nike — competitor to Adidas
data Peloton — here's what I know: [paste notes]
```

---

## When to use which command:

| If you have... | Use... |
|---|---|
| Just a brand name, no data yet | `data [brand]` first, then collect, then `brandy [brand]` |
| Some data already gathered | `brandy [brand] — here's what I found: [paste]` directly |
| A brand name and a competitor to outmaneuver | `data [brand] — competitor to [your brand]` to focus the data plan |
| Already run `data` and collected everything | `brandy [brand] — here's what I found: [paste]` to produce the full audit |

---

## What BRANDY needs to do its best work:
- The brand name (required)
- Your group project brand, if the memo should frame recommendations comparatively (optional but sharpens the output)
- Any observations you've already gathered (optional — BRANDY will attempt to fill gaps from public sources and flag what it cannot verify)

## What BRANDY does when data is missing:
- Attempts to surface publicly observable information (website, social handles, visible ad presence)
- Labels everything: **[Observed]**, **[Inferred from public data]**, or **[Unverifiable — recommend manual check]**
- Flags platforms that require firsthand access (SMS, email newsletters, in-store) and prompts you to investigate those directly


# Appendix

## Brand Details

BRANDY is a structured prompt-based tool for conducting rigorous brand communications audits. It turns a brand name — and whatever data you have — into a documented evidence matrix and a strategic one-page memo. It is designed for MBA brand strategy courses, competitive intelligence work, and communications consulting.

---

## What Problem It Solves

Most brand analyses suffer from the same failure modes: vague observations dressed up as strategy, vanity metrics celebrated without context, and recommendations that float free of any evidence. BRANDY enforces a discipline: every strategic claim must trace back to a specific, labeled observation. If you can't point to it, you can't say it.

---

## Who It's For

- MBA students conducting competitive brand audits for course projects
- Brand strategists preparing competitive intelligence briefs
- Communications consultants documenting a client's market position
- Anyone who needs to turn scattered brand observations into a defensible strategic argument

---

## How It Works

BRANDY runs inside any capable AI assistant (Claude, GPT-4, etc.) as a structured prompt system. You invoke it with simple commands. It does the analytical scaffolding; you supply the brand name and whatever data you have.

Everything BRANDY produces is labeled with one of three epistemic tags:

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **[Observed]** | Directly verifiable from public-facing content |
| **[Inferred]** | Logical deduction from observable signals |
| **[Unverifiable]** | Requires firsthand access — flagged for manual investigation |

---

## Commands

### `brandy [brand name]`
Runs a full brand communications audit. Produces two outputs:

**Part 1 — Brand Observation Matrix**
A structured table documenting the brand's presence, content type, posting frequency, and a strategic interpretation note across every major channel: owned/direct, social, influencer, paid, physical/experiential, and broadcast/print. Roughly 30+ platforms covered. Absence is documented as deliberately as presence.

**Part 2 — Strategic One-Page Memo**
A tightly structured executive memo with: Summary, Context, Recommendation, Rationale, Alternatives Considered, and time-bound Next Steps. Every recommendation cites a specific matrix observation. No generic advice.

**Invocation examples:**
```
brandy Nike
brandy Peloton — here's what I found so far: [paste notes]
brandy Oatly — competitor to Chobani
brandy Duolingo — focus memo on outmaneuvering Babbel
```

---

### `data [brand name]`
Generates a brand-specific data collection plan *before* you run the full audit. Rather than a generic research checklist, `data` analyzes the brand's category, business model, and competitive context to tell you which sources are high-priority for *this brand specifically* and what analysis to run on what you collect.

Produces five sections:

1. **Brand Data Profile** — Why this brand requires a specific data approach
2. **Prioritized Data Source Stack** — Sources ranked Tier 1 / 2 / 3, each with exact URLs, specific metrics to pull, and healthy vs. concerning signal descriptions
3. **Analysis Playbook** — Specific analytical operations, not just data collection (e.g., "calculate comment-to-like ratio on last 12 TikToks and compare against category average of 0.03–0.06")
4. **Brand-Specific Red Flags** — The data patterns most likely to reveal strategic vulnerability for this brand
5. **Competitive Data Pairs** — For each metric, the one or two competitors whose same metric provides the most meaningful benchmark

**Invocation examples:**
```
data Spotify
data Nike — competitor to Adidas
data Peloton — here's what I know: [paste notes]
```

## Recommended Workflow

```
Step 1 → data [brand]          # Get your brand-specific data collection plan
Step 2 → Collect data          # Use the source stack and analysis playbook
Step 3 → brandy [brand] — here's what I found: [paste data]
                               # Run the full audit with your collected data
Step 4 → Review and refine     # Check every memo claim against the matrix
```

If you already have data gathered, skip to Step 3. If you just have a brand name and need a quick audit, `brandy [brand]` alone will surface publicly observable signals and flag what requires manual investigation.

---

## Design Principles

**Observation before judgment.** The matrix is evidence. The memo is argument. BRANDY never collapses them.

**No vanity metrics.** High follower counts without engagement context are noise. Every metric requires a benchmark and a trend direction to mean anything.

**Absence is data.** A platform with no presence is documented and interpreted — not ignored. Strategic silence looks different from accidental neglect.

**Specificity over coverage.** A weak note says "posts regularly, good visuals." A strong note says what the content reveals about strategy, how it compares to a named competitor, and whether it's working by an observable signal.

---

## What BRANDY Does Not Do

- It does not access paid analytics platforms or proprietary data on your behalf
- It cannot subscribe to newsletters, SMS lists, or in-store experiences — these are flagged for manual investigation with specific instructions
- It does not guarantee real-time data accuracy — all findings should be dated and verified before use in a live client or executive context
- It is not a substitute for primary research; it is a framework for making primary and secondary research strategically useful

---

## Output Quality Benchmark

Before accepting any BRANDY output, apply the Audit Integrity Test:

- [ ] Every platform has a documented observation or a documented attempt
- [ ] Every memo recommendation cites a specific matrix observation
- [ ] No claim exists that cannot be traced to [Observed], [Inferred], or [Estimate: benchmark]
- [ ] The memo subject line tells the reader the core argument before line one
- [ ] Next steps are time-bound and actionable, not aspirational

*BRANDY was designed for brand communications coursework and competitive strategy analysis. It operates on the principle that the discipline of observation is itself a strategic skill — and that most brand analysis fails not from lack of data, but from lack of rigor in interpreting what's already visible.*
