# ONE-PAGE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
`onepage_spotify_february_26_2026`

**TO:** Executive Leadership / Board of Directors
**FROM:** BRANDY Audit System
**DATE:** February 26, 2026
**RE:** Spotify's Margin Machine Is Now a Public Document — Move First or Lose the Narrative

---

**Spotify has a four-week window to convert its three most documented financial liabilities into a first-mover transparency story before a journalist, regulator, or competitor does it instead.**

---

**SITUATION · COMPLICATION · RESOLUTION**

Spotify posted record Q4 2025 results — €701M operating income, 33.1% gross margin, 38M net new MAUs. But the architecture producing those margins — ghost artist placement on playlists, algorithmically enforced royalty cuts via Discovery Mode, and a royalty bundling maneuver that halved mechanical payments — is now fully documented in the public record, reproducible by any analyst with a Spotify API key, and supported by internal Slack messages, active federal litigation, and published statistical methodology. The platform that chose transparency before compulsion becomes the cooperative actor in every proceeding that follows; the platform that waited becomes the defendant.

**KEY FINDINGS**

**Ghost artist exposure is no longer investigative — it is methodological.**
· Follower-to-listener ratios diverge 10–3,000× between ghost and organic artists; the methodology is published and reproducible without internal access.
· One composer is behind 656 artist identities and 15 billion streams — and Q4 earnings language ("content cost favorability") maps directly onto it.

**Discovery Mode is generating an estimated $165–330M in annual margin the public cannot see.**
· Confirmed internal documents plus financial modeling against $11B FY2025 payouts support this range.
· Spotify's own employees called it "a negative sum game for artists" in channels that have already been reported.

**Wrapped — the platform's primary brand asset — is running on trust that is measurably eroding.**
· A 50-user Stats.fm study found ~13% of listening time excluded by the November cutoff and 11,000-minute discrepancies between Wrapped rankings and actual counts.
· Wrapped generated 630M shares in 2025 — and increasingly reflects what the algorithm scheduled, not what users chose.

**CALL TO ACTION**

Authorize the Creator Transparency Initiative — Discovery Mode "Supported" labeling, Verified Human Artist badge, and Wrapped dual-data view — for Q2 2026 announcement before any single vector breaks on someone else's terms. Every week of delay narrows the window between voluntary and compelled disclosure, and Apple Music is actively marketing against the gap..
