## PART 1: BRAND OBSERVATION MATRIX

| Platform / Tactic | Link / Handle | Presence | Content Type | Frequency | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **OWNED / DIRECT** | | | | | |
| Brand's Website | spotify.com | Yes-Active | Organic | Continuous | Clean, dark-mode dominant design. Product-forward homepage; Loud and Clear annual payout report lives here and functions as crisis PR instrument, not transparency tool. Advertising B2B portal (Spotify Advertising) is a distinct sub-site, well-developed. [Observed] |
| Brand's App | iOS/Android/Desktop | Yes-Active | Both | Continuous | 751M MAU as of end 2025. Interface recently redesigned toward TikTok-style vertical scroll feed. Persistent user complaints: UI bloat from podcast/audiobook integration, car infotainment sync failures, offline mode bugs, no loop button for free users, can't see playlist song count on mobile. Feature creep is eroding core utility even as new products launch. [Observed — user reviews, community forums] |
| Newsletter / Emails | — | Yes-Active | Both | [Unverifiable — requires subscription] | Discovery Mode and Showcase campaigns are actively marketed to artists via S4A email. Consumer email cadence includes Wrapped, new feature announcements, upgrade prompts. Content quality and tone unverifiable without direct subscription. [Unverifiable — recommend manual check] |
| SMS (text messages) | — | [Unverifiable] | [Unverifiable] | [Unverifiable] | No public SMS program confirmed. Recommend manual check via account signup flow. [Unverifiable — recommend manual check] |
| SEO / SEM | — | Yes-Active | Paid | Continuous | Spotify ranks dominantly for music streaming, playlist, podcast terms. Spotify for Artists content blog functions as organic SEO play targeting musician searches. Discovery Mode and Marquee paid promotion sold to artists via SEM-style framing. [Inferred from public presence] |
| **SOCIAL — PRIMARY** | | | | | |
| Facebook | facebook.com/spotify | Yes-Active | Organic | Several times/week | Large legacy following. Lower engagement relative to platform norms for brand of this scale. Content mirrors Instagram: artist spotlights, Wrapped, playlist features. Not a strategic priority. [Observed] |
| Instagram — Main Feed | @spotify | Yes-Active | Organic | Daily | 14M followers, 7,842 posts. [Observed — direct] Content strategy: artist spotlights, Wrapped data stories, trending cultural moments, product announcements. Tone is playful, Gen Z-coded ("it's never too late to send your crush a playlist"). Experimenting with carousels. Engagement quality unclear — follower count is modest for a 751M-user platform, suggesting brand account is not a primary discovery driver. |
| Instagram — Stories/Reels | @spotify | Yes-Active | Organic | Daily | Active use of Reels for campaign amplification (Wrapped, artist campaigns). 2025 Wrapped visual identity — retro mixtape aesthetic — was coherent across Reels. No evidence of native Reels-first content strategy distinct from feed repurposing. [Observed] |
| YouTube | youtube.com/spotify | Yes-Active | Both | Weekly | Channel used for campaign films, podcast video content, artist content. First-ever TV ad (Wrapped 2025, ITV) generated separate YouTube version. Music videos added to app late 2025, partly as YouTube defensive play. [Observed] |
| TikTok | @spotify | Yes-Active | Organic | Daily | Active presence. Content strategy: trend participation, artist clips, Wrapped moment amplification. Platform is primary discovery funnel for music that then lands on Spotify — the relationship is symbiotic but asymmetric. TikTok replaced editorial playlists as top-of-funnel music discovery by 2020–21. Spotify launched its own vertical scroll feed in 2023 in partial imitation. [Observed] |
| Twitter (X) | @spotify | Yes-Active | Organic | Daily | Active community engagement. "What 2025 is sounding like so far" posts typical content — conversational, community-reactive. Brand voice consistent with Instagram. Community response rate appears low in manual audit. [Observed — PSU student audit, February 2025] |
| Threads | @spotify | Yes-Active | Organic | Several times/week | Presence confirmed; Spotify rolled out DMs on Threads per 2026 social media landscape reporting. Not a strategic priority platform at present. [Observed] |
| LinkedIn | linkedin.com/company/spotify | Yes-Active | Organic | Several times/week | B2B and employer brand focus. Executive thought leadership (Daniel Ek, Marc Hazan). Company culture content. Relevant for AUX consultancy B2B lead generation. [Observed] |
| Pinterest | — | Yes-Dormant | Organic | Infrequent | Presence exists but not a strategic channel. Playlist cover art and Wrapped visual assets occasionally surface. [Inferred — not found as active strategy] |
| Reddit | r/spotify | Yes-Active (community, not brand) | [Not brand-owned] | Daily | Spotify does not operate the subreddit but r/spotify (~500K+ members) is one of the most active ongoing brand perception monitors available. Current dominant threads: Wrapped inaccuracy complaints, UI bloat, Discovery Mode skepticism, price hike frustration. The brand's absence from its own largest online community is a signal. [Observed] |
| Snapchat | — | [Not Found] | — | — | No confirmed active brand strategy on Snapchat. Absence appears deliberate given demographic skew toward younger users who Spotify targets via TikTok and Instagram instead. [Not Found] |
| **INFLUENCE & COMMUNITY** | | | | | |
| Influencers | Multiple | Yes-Active | Both | Ongoing | Heavy influencer/artist integration. Wrapped 2025 TV ad featured Lewis Capaldi, Louis Theroux. OOH campaigns spotlight nominated artists (ARIA Awards 2025: 800+ placements globally). Spotify stages live events used as influencer/micro-celebrity pipeline — artists with streaming data traction booked for first-ever live shows as platform marketing. [Observed] |
| Other social platforms | Roblox ("Spotify Island") | Yes-Active | Organic | Seasonal | Spotify Island on Roblox launched Spotify as first streaming brand on the platform — connecting younger users in virtual space. Tactically interesting but scale unclear. [Observed] |
| **PAID & NATIVE** | | | | | |
| Banner / Display ads | Various | Yes-Active | Paid | Continuous | Active retargeting and display across web. Spotify Ad Exchange (SAX) also sells ad inventory to external brands — Spotify is simultaneously advertiser and advertising platform. Amazon partnership (2025): integrates Amazon shopping signals with Spotify listening data for advertisers. [Observed] |
| Native Content / Affiliate | Various | Yes-Active | Both | Ongoing | AUX in-house consultancy creates branded content partnerships (Coca-Cola "Bestie Mode," BT podcast host-read ads: 674% reported ROAS). Podcast integration provides native ad inventory at scale. Spotify frames this as "streaming intelligence" — mood/behavioral data as targeting substrate. [Observed] |
| **PHYSICAL & EXPERIENTIAL** | | | | | |
| Point of Sale (in-store) | — | No | — | — | No in-store retail presence. Digital-only distribution. [Observed — not applicable to product category] |
| Brick and Mortar | — | No | — | — | No physical retail locations. [Observed — not applicable] |
| Experiential (pop-ups, events) | Multiple cities | Yes-Active | Organic/Paid | Campaign-driven | Spotify Stages (live music events): booked artists with streaming traction for first-ever live shows — Market Hotel Brooklyn, Babies All Right Brooklyn documented in Pelly research. Lady Gaga and Chappell Roan OOH pop-up installations (2025). ARIA Awards 2025 global OOH: 800+ placements across Australia, Times Square NYC, Leicester Square London. Wrapped 2025: OOH campaign in 31 markets. [Observed] |
| Contests / Sweepstakes | Wrapped data sharing | Yes-Active | Organic | Annual (December) | Wrapped functions as participatory contest: users share stats, compete culturally over listening identity. "Share on a Billboard" opt-in (Times Square, Piccadilly Lights, etc.) is the most sophisticated version — user-generated social proof at scale. 300M users engaged, 630M shares in 2025. [Observed] |
| Partnerships | Amazon, FC Barcelona, ARIA, Warner/Boomi, Endel/UMG | Yes-Active | Both | Ongoing | Wide-ranging. Amazon: data integration for advertisers. FC Barcelona: billboard campaign, player playlists. ARIA Awards: first in-app voting-embedded playlists. Warner/Boomi: AI music partnership. Endel/UMG: AI soundscape remixes. Shopify: artist merch/ticket sales direct via app. [Observed] |
| **BROADCAST & PRINT** | | | | | |
| OOH (Billboards, Transit) | Global | Yes-Active | Paid | Campaign-driven + always-on artist billboards | Spotify's most sophisticated paid channel. Three distinct OOH programs: (1) Wrapped data-driven annual campaign — playful user stats on billboards worldwide; (2) Artist Billboard program — Times Square, London, LA — used as artist relations/sentiment management tool; (3) Partnership campaigns (ARIA, FC Barcelona). Wrapped 2025 launched in 31 markets. The data-as-creative approach is category-defining — no competitor consistently executes at this level. [Observed] |
| TV (or streaming equivalent) | ITV (UK), BVOD | Yes-Active | Paid | First deployment 2025 | First-ever linear TV ad purchase: 3-minute prime-time buy on ITV during "I'm A Celebrity..." (Wrapped 2025). Also used BVOD and Spotify Ad Exchange for broadcast-scale buys. Strategic inference: organic Wrapped sharing alone no longer sufficient; platform now using broadcast media to sustain Wrapped as cultural event. [Observed] |
| Radio (or streaming equivalent) | — | Yes-Dormant | — | — | No confirmed paid radio strategy. Ironic given product category. Podcast network functions as de facto owned radio. [Inferred] |
| Print (newspapers, magazines) | — | [Not Found] | — | — | No confirmed print advertising strategy detected. [Not Found] |

## PART 2: STRATEGIC ONE-PAGE MEMO

---

**TO:** Executive Leadership / Brand Strategy Team
**FROM:** BRANDY Audit System
**DATE:** February 25, 2026
**RE:** The Credibility Collapse Waiting to Happen: How Spotify's Say/Do Gap Became Its Defining Strategic Vulnerability

---

**EVIDENCE BASIS**

This memo draws on a 30-platform brand communications audit of Spotify conducted February 25, 2026, combining web research, internal documents reviewed by investigative journalist Liz Pelly (*Mood Machine*, 2025), Nik Bear Brown's data analysis of 25,000 playlist curators and 40 ghost artist profiles (Musinique, February 2026), and the BRANDY Audit Report (brandy_spotify_02_25_2026).

---

**SUMMARY**

Spotify enters 2026 as the dominant audio platform by every measurable metric — 751 million MAUs, 290 million paid subscribers, 31.7% global market share, and improving margins. But beneath those numbers, a structural credibility gap is widening at the exact moment that gap is most likely to be exposed. The platform's public brand — democratizer of music, champion of artists, curator of your most personal listening — is systematically contradicted by its operational behavior: a ghost artist program that replaces real musicians with Swedish stock music producers on its most-followed playlists, a pay-to-play algorithmic promotion scheme generating €61.4 million in annual gross profit, and a royalty bundling maneuver that cut mechanical payments by approximately 50% while the company claimed to be increasing payouts. The risk is not reputational in the abstract. It is legislative, regulatory, and competitive at once, arriving at precisely the moment Spotify's two main rivals are cheaper and its core creator class is organizing.

---

**CONTEXT**

Three observations from the audit matrix drive this memo's central argument.

First, the ghost artist program is documented, scaled, and accelerating. Internal Slack messages reviewed by Pelly show that by 2023, over 100 official Spotify playlists were composed of 90%+ Perfect Fit Content — stock music licensed from Swedish production companies at reduced royalty rates, released under fabricated artist names, placed on playlists with millions of followers without user disclosure. [Observed — internal documents] Brown's statistical analysis found ghost artist follower-to-listener ratios of 0.00005–0.006, compared to 0.05–0.15 for organic artists — a 10 to 3,000× divergence that is the mathematical signature of content being programmed, not discovered. [Observed — Musinique analysis] The program generated €61.4 million in gross profit for Spotify in the 12 months ending May 2023 alone. [Observed — internal Slack]

Second, Spotify is the most expensive standard music service in the US at $12.99/month, with Apple Music at $10.99. In a survey of US Premium users regarding the 2026 price increase, 47% had switched or were considering switching to Apple or YouTube Music. [Observed] Apple is actively marketing against Spotify's price differential. The $2/month gap is not a crisis yet — but it becomes one the moment a triggering event (regulatory action, a viral ghost artist exposé, Wrapped accuracy going mainstream as a story) accelerates churn.

Third, the Living Wage for Musicians Act (introduced March 2024) and active FTC interest in digital payola create a regulatory timeline that now intersects with Spotify's business model in a direct way. If the FTC issues guidance on undisclosed algorithmic promotion under Section 5 — which Future of Music Coalition's Kevin Erickson has explicitly recommended — Discovery Mode, as currently structured, becomes a compliance liability, not merely a reputational one. [Observed — Erickson testimony, public record]

---

**RECOMMENDATION**

**Outmaneuver frame:** Spotify can neutralize its existential vulnerabilities by getting ahead of mandatory disclosure rather than waiting for enforcement — and by converting its data advantage into a transparency asset rather than a surveillance secret.

Specific action: Before the end of Q2 2026, Spotify should publicly implement three changes. First, label Discovery Mode-promoted tracks in the listening interface with a small, tasteful "Supported" indicator — standard practice in digital advertising, normalized in podcast host-read ads, and achievable without disrupting user experience. Second, introduce a "Verified Human Artist" badge and exemption from the 1,000-stream demonetization threshold for independent artists verified as active working musicians. Third, publish Wrapped 2026 with a dual-data view: "Your Algorithmic Favorites" alongside "Your Raw Stream Counts," allowing users to see both the curated and unfiltered picture of their listening year.

Expected outcome: Spotify converts its largest reputational liabilities — opaque payola, demonetization of small artists, Wrapped accuracy questions — into brand differentiators, positioning ahead of the regulatory cycle while generating goodwill in the creator community that is currently organizing against it.

---

**RATIONALE**

Because Discovery Mode generates €61.4M in annual gross profit from artists taking 30% royalty cuts with no listener disclosure, the program's structure is identical to what the FTC's 1960 payola hearings outlawed on radio — and Spotify's own internal Ethics Club acknowledged this in writing. [Observed — internal Slack] Any enforcement action taken before voluntary disclosure will be far more damaging than pre-emptive transparency.

Because 47% of surveyed US Premium users are considering switching to Apple Music or YouTube Music primarily over price, Spotify's $2/month premium needs to be justified by trust and experience quality, not feature count. [Observed — user survey] The ghost artist program and Wrapped accuracy complaints are exactly the stories that accelerate this churn when they break into mainstream coverage — and they are one well-timed investigative piece or congressional hearing away from doing so.

Because the statistical fingerprint of ghost artists is now publicly documented — Brown's analysis gives any journalist or regulator a methodology to independently verify platform-scale displacement — the information asymmetry that has protected the PFC program no longer holds. [Observed — Musinique analysis, February 2026] Spotify's best defense is to surface the story itself before someone else does.

Because the Living Wage for Musicians Act creates a direct pipeline from UMAW organizing to Rep. Tlaib's office to federal legislation, and because the Act's legal foundation is sound (Audio Home Recording Act, Digital Performance in Sound Recordings Act precedents), the political risk is real and not merely rhetorical. [Observed — public record]

---

**ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED**

The obvious alternative is continued denial and crisis management as needed — the posture Spotify has maintained since 2016. This worked when the ghost artist program was reported by Music Business Worldwide without internal documentation. It is less viable now that internal Slack messages, ISRC trace data, and a full-length investigative book have entered the public record. A second alternative is price reduction to match Apple Music's $10.99. This addresses the churn risk but does nothing for the creator credibility problem, and sacrifices the margin improvement that drove Q3 2025 operating income to €582M. The disclosure-plus-creator-protection approach recommended here is more defensible because it converts regulatory risk into brand narrative before that narrative is written by someone else.

---

**NEXT STEPS**

- **By Week 4 (March 25, 2026):** Commission internal audit of Discovery Mode disclosures against FTC Section 5 standards; engage outside counsel on voluntary compliance posture vs. enforcement scenario comparison. Map which markets (EU first, given GDPR precedent from 2023 NOYB case) create highest immediate regulatory exposure.
- **By Week 8 (April 22, 2026):** Test "Supported" track label in one market (suggest UK, where MLC equivalent litigation is most active) and measure skip rate impact. Hypothesis: minimal — users in podcast ecosystem are already habituated to sponsored content indicators.
- **By Week 16 (June 17, 2026):** Announce "Independent Creator Protection" policy: Verified Human Artist designation, 1,000-stream threshold exemption for verified working musicians, and commitment to dual-data Wrapped 2026. Frame as pro-active creator investment, not regulatory compliance. Time announcement for before Q2 earnings call to maximize positive analyst coverage.
