## SECTION 1 — BRAND DATA PROFILE

Spotify's communications footprint is unusual for three reasons that compound each other. First, it is simultaneously a consumer product, a B2B advertising platform, and a creator-facing promotional marketplace — and these three identities carry conflicting incentives that show up in the data. The consumer story is about personal discovery and emotional connection; the advertiser story is about behavioral targeting and mood profiling; the creator story oscillates between democratization myth and monetization reality. Second, the platform's primary annual marketing event — Wrapped — functions as its own data ecosystem, generating billions of social impressions while simultaneously training users to accept surveillance as a delightful personality quiz. Third, the platform is now documenting its own contradictions at scale: internal Slack messages, financial filings, and investigative journalism have produced a public evidence base that makes the gap between what Spotify says and what it does unusually legible. Data collection for this brief must account for all three Spotify personas, and must distinguish between the metrics the company publicizes (users, payouts, Wrapped shares) and the metrics it deliberately obscures (PFC program scope, Discovery Mode gross profit, playlist editorial replacement rates).

## SECTION 3 — ANALYSIS PLAYBOOK

| Data Cluster | Analysis to Run | Benchmark to Compare Against | What You're Looking For |
|---|---|---|---|
| Financial health | Calculate gross margin trajectory: Q4 2024 (32.2%) → Q4 2025 (33.1%) → Q1 2026 guidance (32.8%). Map against Premium ARPU growth (guided 5–6%) and price hike cadence | Netflix gross margin (~40%) as streaming maturity benchmark; Apple Music implied margin (embedded in Services, not disclosed) | Whether Spotify's margin improvement is sustainable or requires continued royalty compression to maintain |
| Discovery Mode economics | Cross-reference internal €61.4M gross profit figure against total Discovery Mode opt-in rate (50%+ of Tier 2–3 artists). Calculate effective per-artist "tax" paid. Compare against what same artists would have earned without 30% royalty cut | Radio promotion budget comparison: major labels historically spend $0.50–$2.00/spin equivalent; Discovery Mode 30% cut on average Tier 3 income of $13,500 = ~$4,050 transferred to Spotify | Whether independent artists are subsidizing major label market share consolidation through pay-to-play |
| Ghost artist statistical fingerprint | Pull follower-to-listener ratios for any artist on official mood playlists (Peaceful Piano, Deep Focus, Songs for Sleeping, Chill Vibes) with >1M monthly listeners. Flag any under 0.01 ratio | Organic DIY artist baseline: 0.05–0.15; Ghost artist range: 0.00005–0.006 per Brown/Musinique analysis | Confirmation that PFC program continues at scale post-Pelly book publication; whether Spotify has made any adjustments |
| Pricing elasticity vs. churn | Track Premium subscriber net adds per quarter alongside price hike timing. Q4 2025: +9M subs despite Q1 2026 being third price hike in four years | Netflix churn rates post-password-sharing crackdown as elasticity comparison; Spotify's own Q1 guidance of only +3M net adds (vs. Q4's +9M) | Whether Wrapped-driven Q4 acquisition is masking churn acceleration in non-Wrapped quarters |
| Wrapped virality health | Measure 2025 vs. 2024 Wrapped engagement: shares, media mentions, organic social posts. Then cross-reference with Stats.fm/Last.fm accuracy complaints volume | 2024 Wrapped: 250M shares (Day 3); 2025 Wrapped: 630M total shares | Whether Wrapped organic amplification is growing or whether it requires increasing paid support (TV buy, OOH expansion to 31 markets) to sustain cultural relevance |
| Creator sentiment | Run S4A blog artist feature analysis: solo vs. band/collective ratio; genre distribution; whether featured artists are on major labels, AWAL/DSP-distributed, or truly independent | BRANDY audit finding: 70%+ of S4A blog features are solo acts | Whether Spotify's model independent artist archetype has shifted toward or away from the "indie DIY" framing it claims |
| Competitive pricing gap | Compare Spotify Individual ($12.99), Apple Music ($10.99), YouTube Music ($10.99) against included features: lossless audio (Apple: included; Spotify: included in select markets), music videos (Spotify: beta; Apple: included), podcast (Spotify: strong; Apple: moderate) | Survey finding: 47% of US Premium users considering switching over price | Whether Spotify's feature set justifies the premium, or whether the gap narrows Apple's case |

## SECTION 4 — BRAND-SPECIFIC RED FLAGS TO HUNT

1. **The Wrapped Accuracy Collapse:** Stats.fm and Last.fm users are already reporting systematic discrepancies between tracked listening and Wrapped results. If this reaches mainstream media as a story — particularly framed as "Spotify's Wrapped shows you what the algorithm wants you to think you listened to, not what you actually listened to" — it simultaneously damages the personalization brand, the surveillance-as-delight narrative, and the primary organic marketing engine. Look for: volume of accuracy complaint posts on r/spotify in December 2025 vs. 2024; any mainstream press pickup; any journalist with a Stats.fm comparison story. → *Why it would matter:* Wrapped generated 630M shares in 2025. That machine runs on trust in the data. Erosion of that trust is an asymmetric risk — it takes years to build and one viral moment to break.

2. **Discovery Mode Disclosure Enforcement:** The FTC's explicit mandate under Section 5 covers "deceptive practices" in commerce. Kevin Erickson (Future of Music Coalition) has publicly recommended a Section 5 rule-making banning digital payola on any streaming service. The MLC's active appeal of the bundling ruling signals that rights holders are now litigation-willing. If these two vectors converge — FTC inquiry + MLC win on appeal — Spotify faces mandatory disclosure requirements for Discovery Mode at minimum, and potential disgorgement of proceeds at maximum. Look for: any FTC staff reports on music streaming; any Congressional hearing with Spotify executives; any new plaintiff joining the MLC appeal. → *Why it would matter:* €61.4M annual gross profit from undisclosed pay-to-play becomes a direct liability if regulators define it as unlawful deception.

3. **PFC Scale Post-Pelly:** The book *Mood Machine* was published in early 2025. Spotify has not publicly addressed the PFC program by name, nor disclosed its scope. The question is whether internal behavior has changed (editors reducing PFC percentage, Strategic Programming team restructured) or whether the program continues at same scale under lower scrutiny. Look for: any change in ghost artist presence on top 10 mood playlists (Peaceful Piano, Deep Focus, Songs for Sleeping); any Spotify blog post acknowledging the program; any personnel changes in Strategic Programming team on LinkedIn. → *Why it would matter:* If the program continues unchanged post-Pelly, Spotify has made a calculated bet that mainstream audiences won't care. If it's been quietly wound down, that's a story too — one that confirms the fraud and raises questions about what replaced it.

4. **AI Music Flood Trigger:** Daniel Ek publicly described AI-generated music as a "great cultural opportunity." Boomi (14.5M AI-generated songs) already has a Warner Music partnership. The question is whether AI-generated content begins displacing human PFC artists from mood playlists at scale in 2026 — which would be simultaneously cheaper than PFC and harder to detect than named ghost artists. Look for: any new AI music generators landing major label or Spotify partnerships; any increase in tracks with zero artist social presence and sub-2-minute durations appearing on editorial playlists. → *Why it would matter:* If AI displaces the last human layer from mood playlists, the "democratization" claim becomes not just inaccurate but actively ironic — and the Living Wage for Musicians Act becomes urgently relevant.

5. **Ad Revenue Structural Weakness:** Q4 2025 ad-supported revenue declined 4% YoY on a reported basis (+4% constant currency). The pricing softness in music advertising is a real signal that Spotify's "streaming intelligence" pitch to advertisers may be overstated — if the mood/behavioral targeting data doesn't deliver the conversion rates Spotify promises, the B2B revenue case erodes. Look for: any advertiser-side case study data that contradicts Spotify's reported ROAS numbers; any agency-side commentary on Spotify's CPM trends vs. competitors; Q1 2026 ad revenue guidance (not separated from total in current reports). → *Why it would matter:* Advertising is Spotify's stated growth vector (target: 20% of revenue). If the ad product underdelivers on targeting promises, the entire "surveillance as value creation" model is under pressure.

6. **Churn Acceleration in Non-Wrapped Quarters:** Q4 2025 net adds: +9M Premium subs. Q1 2026 guidance: +3M. That's a 67% sequential drop in net subscriber additions despite continued price hikes in 150+ markets. The question is whether Q1 2026 comes in below guidance — which would signal that Wrapped is papering over structural churn that accelerates when the cultural moment fades. Look for: Q1 2026 earnings (scheduled ~May 2026); any analyst commentary on churn rates; any MIDiA Research updates on listening time migration to YouTube. → *Why it would matter:* If premium subscriber growth is increasingly Wrapped-dependent, the brand's cultural relevance is both its greatest asset and its most concentrated risk.

## SECTION 5 — COMPETITIVE DATA PAIRS

| Metric | Spotify Source | Best Benchmark Competitor | Competitor Source | Why This Pairing |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Global paid subscribers | 290M (Q4 2025, SEC 6-K) | Apple Music: ~94–110M | Apple Services revenue disclosures + third-party estimates (DataGlobeHub, Vaizle) | Most direct subscription volume comparison; Apple is only purely premium-tier competitor |
| Global market share (paid subs) | 31.7% (Q4 2025) | Apple Music: ~12–20%; Tencent: ~14%; Amazon: ~11% | Mordor Intelligence, SXM Business, Pianodreamers market share aggregations | Share trajectory matters more than absolute — Spotify has held 30–37% for years; stability here is the story |
| Per-stream artist payout | ~$0.003–0.005 (Spotify estimate) | Apple Music: ~$0.01/stream | DataGlobeHub Apple Music Statistics; Vaizle Spotify Statistics | Apple Music pays ~3x per stream; most cited differentiator in creator community; "artist needs 3x more Spotify streams to match Apple Music earnings" is a recurring data point |
| US market share | ~36–37% | Apple Music: ~30.7% | DMN Pro Q3 2025 data; Affinco Apple Music Statistics | US is highest-ARPU market; Apple is closing the gap in the US specifically, partly via Family plan dominance |
| Ad revenue trajectory | -4% YoY Q4 2025 (reported); +4% constant currency | YouTube Music: ad revenue growing (YouTube total music industry contribution $8B, Jul 2024–Jun 2025) | Digital Music News, YouTube/Google earnings commentary | YouTube operates dual-model (free ad-supported + subscription) that Spotify doesn't; YouTube's ad growth vs. Spotify's ad softness is a structural comparison worth tracking |
| Gross margin | 33.1% (Q4 2025 record) | Netflix: ~40% (streaming maturity proxy); Apple Music: embedded in Services, not disclosed | Netflix SEC filings; Apple Services segment disclosures | Netflix is the benchmark for what streaming margins can reach at scale; Spotify's 33% in 2025 shows trajectory toward but not yet at streaming maturity |
| Listening time per user | ~104 minutes/day average (2025 industry estimate) | Apple Music: desktop/Mac users show longest sessions; YouTube: dominant for DJ sets and video | SQ Magazine streaming statistics; MIDiA Research (Spotify listening time -25% shift to YouTube) | Session length is Spotify's internal success metric; losing minutes to YouTube is the most concrete behavioral threat |
| Average daily AI playlist usage | AI DJ usage +48% in 2025 among Premium subs | Apple Music: "Personalized daily mixes contribute 65% of user engagement combined with Amazon Music" | SQ Magazine, DataGlobeHub | AI-driven listening share tells you how much control the platform has ceded from editorial to algorithm — and whether users are embracing or resisting it |

## DATA GAPS — WHAT THIS BRIEF CANNOT TELL YOU

The following are **[Unverifiable — recommend manual check]** items that require firsthand access or FOIA/regulatory action to confirm:

- **Exact PFC program scope post-Pelly** (February 2026): Whether Strategic Programming team activity has changed since *Mood Machine* publication. Manual check: pull current playlist composition data for top 20 mood playlists and run Brown's follower/listener ratio methodology.
- **Discovery Mode gross profit Q4 2025 / FY 2025**: Internal Slack data covers through May 2023. Whether this grew toward Spotify's stated target of influencing 30–50% of all on-platform recommendations is not publicly known.
- **Wrapped 2025 algorithmic bias confirmation**: Whether Stats.fm discrepancies are systematic (confirming label-promoted content inflates Wrapped results) or user error. Requires side-by-side data comparison from ~50 Stats.fm users.
- **Current Firefly/Epidemic placement share on editorial playlists**: Brown's dataset is from February 2026 analysis but represents a sample. Full picture requires complete playlist scrape with ISRC trace against Swedish STIM registry.
- **Ad-supported gross margin**: Spotify reports blended gross margin; ad-supported vs. Premium gross margin split is not disclosed. Understanding the ad business unit's actual profitability matters given the stated goal of growing ad revenue to 20% of total.

## SECTION 6 — QUANTIFIED DATA GAPS (Updated from Forensic Audit, February 2026)

The following items have been partially illuminated by a forensic audit of post-Pelly Strategic Programming activity conducted February 2026. Each remains [Unverifiable] in full but is now better bounded.

**Gap 1: PFC Program Scope Post-Pelly**

Follower/listener ratio taxonomy now confirmed across three artist classifications:

| Artist Classification | Monthly Listener Profile | Follower/Listener Ratio | Platform Logic |
|---|---|---|---|
| Legacy/Active Artist | Broad, multi-source reach | >0.15 (15%+) | Organic fan community; high search intent |
| Viral/Trend Artist | Spike-based, single-source | 0.02–0.08 | Temporary algorithmic lift; low long-term retention |
| PFC/Ghost Artist | Narrow, playlist-locked | <0.005 (0.5%) | Strategic Programming placement; high passivity |

Manual observation of top 20 mood playlists post-Pelly (February 2026) indicates that verified-artist badges for pseudonymous profiles have increased — consistent with Spotify's cosmetic response to scrutiny — but underlying engagement metrics remain characteristic of non-organic growth. [Observed — forensic audit, February 2026]

Johan Röhr has been identified as the composer behind 2,700+ songs under 656 different artist names, accumulating over 15 billion streams — statistically the most-played artist in Sweden by stream count, surpassing Avicii in monthly listener counts. [Observed — Dagens Nyheter / Musinique analysis]

Firefly Entertainment ISRC country/agency code: SE-4RG. Catfish Recording: SE-XGF. Both traceable through Swedish STIM registry. In "Stress Relief" playlist (1.45M followers), up to 20% of content authored by a single Swedish composer using dozens of aliases. [Observed — playlist scrape, February 2026, sampled]

The exact PFC streamshare percentage in 2026 remains unconfirmed. What is confirmed: the Q4 2025 gross margin expansion of 83 basis points was attributed by management to "content cost favorability" — and this favorability is structurally consistent with increased PFC deployment. [Inferred — Q4 2025 earnings commentary]

**Gap 2: Discovery Mode Gross Profit (FY 2025)**

The internal 2023 figure of €61.4M annual gross profit from Discovery Mode is the last confirmed data point. FY 2025 figure is unconfirmed but can be bounded mathematically:

If Spotify paid out $11 billion in 2025, and conservatively 10% of those streams were subject to Discovery Mode's 30% royalty reduction:

**Discovery Mode margin recapture = 0.30 × 0.10 × $11B = ~$330M**

This would represent nearly half of Q4 2025's quarterly operating income of €701M across the full year. Even at 5% of streams, the figure is ~$165M — a material contribution that is entirely invisible in public reporting. [Estimated — financial modeling from confirmed inputs]

The internal target of Discovery Mode influencing 30–50% of all on-platform recommendations has not been confirmed as achieved. The 50%+ Tier 2–3 opt-in rate (confirmed via Slack through 2023) suggests trajectory toward that target, not arrival. [Inferred]

**Gap 3: Wrapped 2025 Systematic Bias — Now Partially Quantified**

Stats.fm side-by-side comparison study (approximately 50 users reporting discrepancies) reveals a pattern of systematic rather than random deviation:

| Data Point | Spotify Wrapped 2025 | Stats.fm (API-Derived) | Discrepancy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total Listening Time | ~48,000 minutes | ~55,000 minutes | ~13% exclusion (Nov/Dec cutoff) |
| Top Artist Ranking | Marketable/label-promoted | Absolute play count | 11,000-minute deviation in top artist data documented |
| Small Artist Inclusion | Often omitted if <1,000 streams | Included in Top 5 | Algorithmic masking of independent content |
| Background Play Weighting | Dominant in Top Songs | Weighted as secondary | Lo-fi/PFC content accumulates repeat counts |

User accounts on r/Vent and r/Statsfm document cases where top artists in Stats.fm were entirely absent from Wrapped, replaced by tracks the user had explicitly blocked or only encountered via Autoplay. [Observed — community forums, December 2025]

**The 30-second structural bias:** Because any play over 30 seconds counts as a full stream, shorter tracks (90-second mood beats, lo-fi clips) punch far above their weight vs. longer compositions (8-minute jazz, prog rock). This formula inherently biases Wrapped's "Top Songs" list toward background content regardless of user intent — and reinforces the PFC ecosystem by making ghost artist content appear in "your" year-end story. [Observed — structural analysis]

**Gap 4: Standalone Ad-Supported Gross Margin — Now Modeled**

Spotify reports blended gross margin only. Analyst modeling of Q4 2025 segment split:

| Business Segment | Q4 2025 Revenue | Estimated Gross Margin | Profitability Driver |
|---|---|---|---|
| Premium | €4.01B | ~34.8% | Price hikes; audiobook bundling reducing mechanical royalties |
| Ad-Supported | €518M | ~19.5% | Podcast sponsorship gains; Spotify Ad Exchange yield |
| Blended | €4.53B | 33.1% (confirmed) | Record financial execution |

The jump in ad-supported gross margin from ~15% to ~19.5% in a single year is material. However, management acknowledged that ad margins temporarily benefited from transfer of Spotify Partner Program costs to the Premium segment — a tailwind that likely ended after December 2025. The ad-supported segment's true standalone profitability in Q1 2026 will be the test of whether the improvement is structural or accounting. [Inferred — Q4 2025 earnings commentary + analyst modeling]

Ad-supported revenue as % of total: 11.4% in Q4 2025 vs. long-term target of 20%. The gap is structural: 476 million free-tier users being monetized at below-target ARPU, with music advertising showing "softness in pricing" even as impression volume grows. [Observed — Q4 2025 SEC 6-K]

**Gap 5: Firefly/Epidemic Total Editorial Placement Share**

Nick Holmstén (former Spotify Head of Music, TuneGo founder) has been linked to Firefly Entertainment founders through TSX Entertainment, a music-themed venture. This extends the documented personal connection (childhood friendship, Apple Brown Betty band) into a current business relationship. [Observed — forensic audit, February 2026]

Full editorial placement share requires complete playlist scrape + ISRC trace against STIM registry. Current sampled data: Firefly (SE-4RG), Catfish Recording (SE-XGF), Epidemic Sound/Overtone (varies) all confirmed present in editorial mood playlists. Scale beyond sample: [Unverifiable — requires full platform scrape]

**Additional finding: The Southeast European Cultural Erasure Signal**

Artists from Southeast Europe have documented that the 1,000-stream royalty threshold effectively silences regional niche genres. In a system where 70% of Spotify's 256 million songs are never played, low-velocity local content is demonetized at the same time mood playlist real estate is captured by Swedish production houses. This is the most concrete example of how the PFC program + demonetization policy compound into cultural erasure that is geographically and ethnically patterned. [Observed — artist community reporting, late 2025]
